> Inheritance in C++

# Why use inheritance?
-  reuse existing classes.
-  create new classes from existing classes.
-  create new behaviours in the inherited classes.
-  types: private, protected, public
-  abstract classes as base templates
-  single inheritance , we derive from a single base class 
-  mutiple inheritance, we derive from multiple base classes


**Class A {}** // base class, or super class or parent class
*Class B: private  A {}*
*Class C: protected A {}*
*Class D: public  A {}*

### Has-A relatioship aka Composition

-  person has an account
