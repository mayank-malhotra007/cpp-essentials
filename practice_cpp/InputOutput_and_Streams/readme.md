# Input and Output Streams

Also called I/O streams are how the program interacts with the outer world, reading data in and writing data out.

## Input Stream (std::istream)

Used to read in data into the program.
- most commonly used object std::cin, using the extraction operation >>
- reads from standard input like the keyboard

## Output Stream(std::ostream)
- most commonly object is the std::cout, using insertion operator <<
- writes to standard output like the monitor

## In/Out Stream(std::iostream)
- read and write


## Why we need streams?
- hardware abstraction
- operator overloading
- type safety
- flexibility to work with files, strings, consoles, etc

## Commonly Used Streams
- fstream
- iostream
- iomanip
- stringstream
