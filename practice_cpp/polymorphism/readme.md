# Polymorphism

Polymorphism means many forms, allows objects to be treated as instances of base class, even 
though they are instances of derived class.

## Types of Polymorphism in C++

1. Static binding: objects are binded at compile time: function overloading, operator overloading

2. Dyanamic binding: objects are binded at run time: function overriding. Uses virtual functions and inheritance.

## Need

- brings advantages of inheritance and overloading together.
