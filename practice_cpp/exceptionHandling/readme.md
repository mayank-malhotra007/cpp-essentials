# Exception Handling

Is a mechanism in C++ that deals with runtime errors or unexpected events.
Uses three keywords: __try__, __throw__, __catch__

- prevent the program from crashing
- give meaningful names to error messages
- contan damage
- provides safety net
- the compiler sees which function handles the catch handler, a function which does not have a catch handle will be poppped off the stack, its local variables destroyed and destructors called
